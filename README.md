# Deep Q-Network (DQN) for Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP)

This repository contains an implementation of a Deep Q-Network (DQN) applied to solving the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP). The code is designed to demonstrate how reinforcement learning can be used to optimize routing decisions in logistics and transportation.

## Overview

The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is a classic optimization problem where the goal is to determine the optimal routes for a fleet of vehicles to service a set of customers, minimizing total cost while satisfying constraints such as vehicle capacity.

In this implementation, we use a DQN, a reinforcement learning algorithm, to learn effective routing policies by interacting with a simulated environment.
